Brief Project Description
It was nice working on this project. It has taken me about 4 days to submit this though i am still working on it (Better than nothing) as I had difficulty making POST and PUT request to the server.
Hardest part to implement? Not sure I will use the word "hard" but basically the comment edit side note and modal.
Functionalities I'm proud of? Probably the Range Slider. I do hope you like what I have done.

Client
This project was generated with Create-React-App v16.8.6

Development server
LOCAL SERVER: Navigate(cd) into the Api folder and run "yarn start" to get the server up and running.
