# Brief Project Description

It was nice working on this project. It has taken me about 4 days to submit this though I had difficulty making a POST request of the image and PUT request to the server.
Hardest part to implement? Not sure I will use the word "hard" but basically the comment edit side note and modal.
Functionalities I'm proud of? Probably the Range Slider. 

## Client

This project was generated with Create-React-App v16.8.6

# Development server

### LOCAL SERVER:

- Navigate(cd) into the Api folder
- run "yarn start" to get the server up and running.
-

### REACT SERVER

- Just run "yarn start" directly in that environment.

I do hope you like what I have done.
